\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to give an insight into how a diagram drawing
tool was created and how the choices and priorities formed the project. 

The aim for the project was to build a useable prototype of a diagram tool for 
the Windows
platform using the \texttt{Windows Presentation Framework (WPF)}. Since the project is
created as a part of an only 5 ECTS points course, defining the scope is also an
important part of the task.

Since the product is not to be used by realworld customers, sometimes only the
most important aspects of a problem is solved, and tasks such as implementing a
greater varity of for
example relational arrows were not prioritized.

The overall structure of the report consists of the
\textit{Analysis} which outlines what exactly the application should do and a
\textit{Design and implementation} section that explains how it was achieved. In the \textit{Test} section
we validate that the solution indeed is solid and finally the project is wrapped
up in the \textit{Discussion} and \textit{Conclusion} section.

\subsection{Division of work}
In this project all members have contributed evenly to every part of the 
program and the report. Thus we have not put any names on any methods in the 
program or on any sections in the report.
